I am a PhD candidate at the [Institute of Economic Studies, Charles University](https://ies.fsv.cuni.cz/en), a PhD Researcher with the [CORPTAX group](https://centreforpublicfinance.eu/), and a Research Fellow at [Skatteforsk](https://www.nmbu.no/en/research/skatteforsk-tax-center).

My research focuses on wealth taxation and illicit financial flows. I have led seminars on measuring illicit financial flows and profit shifting for government officials in Nigeria. Through my work, I aim to improve the design of tax systems and contribute to evidence-based solutions that address global tax abuse and inequality.

In addition to my research, I serve as a teaching assistant and teach seminars for the undergraduate courses [Public Finance](https://is.cuni.cz/studium/eng/predmety/index.php?do=predmet&kod=JEB025), [Econometrics I](https://is.cuni.cz/studium/eng/predmety/index.php?do=predmet&kod=JEB109), and [European Economic Integration](https://is.cuni.cz/studium/eng/predmety/index.php?do=predmet&kod=JEB026), as well as the graduate course [Public Economics](https://is.cuni.cz/studium/eng/predmety/index.php?do=predmet&kod=JEM203).
