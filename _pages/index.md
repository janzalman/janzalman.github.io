I am a PhD candidate at the [Institute of Economic Studies, Charles University](https://ies.fsv.cuni.cz/en), a PhD Researcher with the [Centre for Public Finance](https://centreforpublicfinance.eu/), and a Research Fellow at [Skatteforsk](https://www.nmbu.no/en/research/skatteforsk-tax-center).

My [research](https://janzalman.github.io/research/) focuses on illicit financial flows, wealth taxes, and property taxes. Through my work, I aim to improve the design of tax systems and contribute to evidence-based solutions that address global tax abuse and inequality. 

I have led seminars on measuring illicit financial flows and profit shifting for government officials in Nigeria. I also engage in Czech policy analysis, collaborating with the [Centre for Public Finance](https://centreforpublicfinance.eu/) on focused on tax reform studies.
