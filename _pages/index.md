I am a PhD candidate at the [Institute of Economic Studies, Charles University](https://ies.fsv.cuni.cz/en), a PhD Researcher with the [CORPTAX group](https://centreforpublicfinance.eu/), and a Research Fellow at [Skatteforsk](https://www.nmbu.no/en/research/skatteforsk-tax-center). I am also involved in the [DemoTrans project](https://feb.kuleuven.be/drc/LEER/demotrans/demotrans), which explores ways to strengthen democratic governance through more accountable, transparent, and effective institutions. Currently, I am visiting [STAX](https://stax.stanford.edu/) at the beautiful Stanford University (hosted by Juan Carlos Suárez Serrato, September-December 2025).

My [research](https://janzalman.github.io/research/) focuses on property taxes, wealth taxes and illicit financial flows. Through my work, I aim to improve the design of tax systems and contribute to evidence-based solutions that address global tax abuse and inequality. I have led seminars on measuring illicit financial flows and profit shifting for government officials in Nigeria.

I engage in Czech policy analysis, collaborating with [PAQ Research](https://www.paqresearch.cz/) and the [Centre for Public Finance](https://centreforpublicfinance.eu/) on studies focused on reforming capital income tax, inheritance tax, and wealth taxation. We have recently published a [study](https://chytrejsidane.cz/) (available only in Czech) on reforming the Czech tax system to foster economic growth, strengthen social mobility, improve its coherence, and ensure the sustainability of public finances.

In addition to my research, I serve as a teaching assistant and teach seminars for the undergraduate courses [Public Finance](https://is.cuni.cz/studium/eng/predmety/index.php?do=predmet&kod=JEB025), [Econometrics I](https://is.cuni.cz/studium/eng/predmety/index.php?do=predmet&kod=JEB109), and [European Economic Integration](https://is.cuni.cz/studium/eng/predmety/index.php?do=predmet&kod=JEB026), as well as the graduate course [Public Economics](https://is.cuni.cz/studium/eng/predmety/index.php?do=predmet&kod=JEM203).

I also have a background in humanitarian finance, working as a Finance Officer for a mission in Myanmar, where I focused on budget oversight, financial coordination, and donor accountability within an international NGO [People in Need](https://www.peopleinneed.net/).
